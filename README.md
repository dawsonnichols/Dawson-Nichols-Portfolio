The aim of this project was to provide future employer's with a simple page to view my own work in the form of a portfolio. 

This portfolio was made using Bootsrap 5 CSS framework and FontAwesome themes. 
    
    As an example: The navbar is based off of one provided in the docs of Boostrap 5:
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/navbars/
    Though this source was used as a refernce point, the code was highly altered for my own purposes. 

FontAwesome provided the icons used for the phone and email buttons, and the play button in the center of the record player image at the top right.
